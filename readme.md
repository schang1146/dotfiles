# dotfiles

my attempt at a dotfiles repository. honestly, you probably shouldn't run any of this yourself. hopefully the lack of casing in this readme will deter anyone who wanders upon this readme. everything is subject to change on a whim and is going to be a frankenstein mashup of examples of what i've found out in the wild and duct tape - lots and lots of duct tape.

## installation

clone repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/schang1146/dotfiles
```

run

```sh
./scripts/bootstrap
```

to set up your gitconfig and symlink all the things

run

```sh
./scripts/install
```

to install all `install.sh` files

## thanks

special thanks to those who have come before me and have left great examples on what you can do with dotfiles
