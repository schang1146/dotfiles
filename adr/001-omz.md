# Oh My Zsh Usage

## Context and Problem Statement

There is an end goal of having an easy to maintain and configure shell. Zsh was originally selected for its better features over Bash including (but not limited to) theme/plugin support and cd automation.

## Considered Options

- Use [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
- Customize Zsh from the ground up

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Customize Zsh from the ground up**

### Positive Consequences

- Much more control over what functions, aliases, and configuration options are used

### Negative Consequences

- There will be a lot more overhead in getting to a stable shell environment

## Reasoning

While testing Oh My Zsh, initially it was a great UX in getting a base working shell set up.

- Theming only required setting certain environment variables
- Plugins were easily turned on/off by modifying an array
- Custom plugins were easy to install - clone into \*/plugins folder and add to plugins array

Unfortunately there was a lot more going on in the background and the source code seemed a bit messy diving deeper into OMZ's repo.

- A **lot** of miscellaneous helper functions existed to support some of its themes/plugins.
- Rather large framework to support only a select few features I wanted
- There was a lot of fluff and aliases compiled by the community - there were a few awesome ones, but mostly stuff I'll never use
